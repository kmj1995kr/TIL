### Dev Ops: Automation

Why is automation needed?

- Fast deloymentminn
  - Can deploy in small chunks - easy to spot and update SW errors as they arise
- Frequent updates and deployments possible
- Stable



### Methods of Practicing Dev Ops

- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery
- Coninuous Deployment
- TDD (Test Driven Deployment)

Micro Service Architecture (MSA)



### Dev Ops Using AWS

- **CodeBuild**: helps to build project codes and perform unit tests

- **CodeDeploy**: enables automation of deployment

- **CodePipeline**: helps to build a pipeline from source code commit to deployment
  - Artifact: similar to parameters; used to pass off the necessary values going from one function to the next



### Serverless Architecture

- Each components need to be broken up as **services** (each service components should be able to run independent from each other)
  - Each functions should be separated
  - Front end and the logic should also be independent
